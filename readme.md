# TrashOverflow üöÆ | Deep Learning for Waste Management

An innovative project aimed at tackling the issue of overflowing waste bins using a deep learning-based classification system, real-time data, and an interactive GUI for public use. **TrashOverflow** enhances waste management systems and promotes efficient resource allocation for a cleaner environment.

---

## üîç **Project Overview**
TrashOverflow leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** pipeline to classify waste bins as clean or overflowing. The system is designed to process real-time input, making it suitable for integration into smart city waste management systems.

By integrating **data scraping**, **augmentation pipelines**, and **interactive visualizations**, this project provides a comprehensive solution to mitigate overflowing bins and optimize waste collection routes.

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Real-Time Waste Classification:** Accurate identification of overflowing bins using trained CNN models.
- **Interactive GUI:** Enables real-time user interaction and displays the classification results, making it user-friendly for operators.
- **Optimized Data Pipelines:** Robust preprocessing and augmentation techniques for real-world deployment.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Can be deployed on edge devices, enabling on-site detection and reporting.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, KNIME
- **GUI:** Tkinter (or custom solution used for GUI)
- **Tools:** KNIME for preprocessing, data augmentation, and model optimization

## üìà **System Workflow**
1. **Data Collection:** Collected and labeled images from both public datasets and online sources using custom scraping scripts.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Enhanced training robustness through data augmentation techniques including scaling, cropping, and flipping.
3. **Training Pipeline:** Trained a CNN model using Keras, tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal accuracy (~80%).
4. **Real-Time Classification:** Integrated the trained model with a GUI for end-user interaction.
5. **Scalability:** Designed for potential deployment on IoT-enabled waste bins.
